# Airline Aviation Accident Analysis

**Authors**: Franko Ndou, Lucas Kimball

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on [aviation accident](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses) data. Through a thorough examination of the dataset, our aim is to offer customized recommendations to companies based on their safety requirements. Furthermore, our analysis will provide valuable insights for companies in effectively managing and operating an airline, thus minimizing unwarranted risks to both employees and passengers.

## Business Problem

The startup company **"Landmark Airlines"** is embarking on creating a domestic airline dedicated to serving upper-class Americans and business executives. The company is currently focused on acquiring and operating airplanes for both commercial and private use. They are particularly interested in catering to the needs of private individuals or groups of executives who might require charter services. However, Landmark Airlines lacks sufficient knowledge regarding the potential risks associated with aircraft operations. It is our responsibility to assess and identify the aircraft options with the lowest risks, providing actionable insights for the head of the new aviation division. These insights will play a pivotal role in guiding the company's decisions regarding which aircraft to invest in for this promising new business venture.

Questions to consider:
* What is the total fatality rate and using it to Analyze fatality rates based on makes and models?
* What is the fatality rate of VMC and IMC flights compared to the average flight fatality rate?
* What is the number of accidents per month and per day of the week since 1995?
***

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
